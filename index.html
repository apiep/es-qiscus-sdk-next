# qiscus sdk <strike>web</strike> javascript

An idea or proposal for the future of qiscus sdk on javascript land

---
class: middle
## The current qiscus sdk web

- Has multiple repo
- Not so good release cycle
- To much hassle when client (with tech knowledge)
  want to implement it on their codebase
- No support for popular framework (without hacky implementation)
---
class: middle
## The proposed idea

- Monorepo
- Has full support for popular framework
  - React
  - Vue
  - Angular
  - React Native
  - Flutter??
- require-able via npm
- cdn-able via unpkg.com, etc.
---
class: middle
## Monorepo
### current state:

- qiscus/qiscus-sdk-web-core
- qiscus/qiscus-ui-vue
- qiscus/react-native-qiscus-sdk-js
- qiscus/qiscus-react-native-js-example
- qiscus/react-native-qiscus-streaming
- qiscus/react-qiscusios

> Not so clean, much trouble finding the right repository
---
class: middle
## Monorepo
### proposed state:

- qiscus/qiscus-sdk-javascript
  - packages/core
  - packages/ui-vue
  - packages/ui-react [to-do]
  - packages/ui-angular [to-do]
  - packages/ui-react-native
  - packages/ui-widget [to-do]
  - packages/example-react-component
  - packages/example-vue-component
  - packages/etc
---
class: middle
## Full support for popular framework
### Current

- Manually `qiscus.render()`
- React instance did not know about our chat view
- Manually <i>destroy</i> qiscus instance when chat
  component need to be hidden
---
class: middle
## Full support for popular framework
### Proposed

- Make qiscus sdk component for those framework

Example:
```html
<App>
  <Qiscus core={qiscusSDKCore} />
</App>
```
---
class: middle
## Full support for popular framework
### Proposed - more example

```html
<App>
  <Qiscus.Container core={qiscusSDKCore}>
    <Qiscus.Header>
      // Client custom header
    </Qiscus.Header>
    <Qiscus.ChatList>
      // Client custom chat list
    </Qiscus.ChatList>
  </Qiscus.Container>
</App>
```

# Require-able from npm

All project under `packages` directory
will have it own package on npm as:
- @qiscus/core
- @qiscus/ui-vue
- @qiscus/ui-react
- etc

Those make it easier for existing client
that utilizing npm as their application
dependencies management

# CDN-able via unpkg.com

<small>From unpkg website</small>
> unpkg is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on npm.

Because we already had<sup>(soon)</sup> our sdk on npm, we can utilize
unpkg for our CDN, so it will be much more cleaner. Like:

https://unpkg.com/@qiscus/core

or with version specified

https://unpkg.com/@qiscus/core@2.4.5

or with direct file access

https://unpkg.com/@qiscus/core@2.4.5/dist/qiscus-sdk.min.js
